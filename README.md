Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company that takes care of customers financial plan and goals. They hired us to make a application and secure it since it will be holding customer valuable data.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I think what i did well was finding and fixing the vulnerablilties. It took a long time to figure this out but after finding out how to do this, it was cake walk. Securing the code is to prevent from hackers gaining valuable data.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The marven dependency check took is extremly helpful thoughout the course. It would list all the vulnerabilities instead of having to find each one manually.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I believe in the future i would use testing that penetrates to see if there is more vulnerabilities.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Runnning the marven dependency check mulitple times to make sure that all the vulnerabilities were patched up.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Internet, youtube, reddit and the book has helped greatly in this course.
